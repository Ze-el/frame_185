# Frame --- CS185 W26 Project

Seamless photo sharing across iOS and Android because memories deserve
to be shared, not managed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Overview

Frame is a research-driven design project exploring how event-based
photo sharing can be automated to eliminate friction.

Instead of manually sorting photos, creating albums, and sending links
across multiple platforms, Frame proposes:

-   Automatic event detection\
-   Intelligent photo grouping\
-   Smart, secure share links\
-   Transparent AI-assisted workflows

This website documents the full research and development journey from
GR1 through GR7.

## Research Progression (GR1--GR7)

### GR1 --- Initial Research

Identified user frustration around post-event photo organization.

### GR2 --- Refined Interviews

Validated that sharing primarily occurs after social events (parties,
trips, campus gatherings).

### GR3 --- Problem Framing

How might we make sharing event photos effortless and intelligent
without requiring manual sorting?

### GR4 --- Ideation

Explored multiple solutions including manual tagging, QR-based grouping,
and collaborative albums.\
Automatic grouping was selected due to lowest friction.

### GR5 --- Prototype

Tested upload flow, grouping visualization, and smart sharing mechanics.

### GR6 --- Street Testing

Observed real users interacting with event photos.\
Identified need for transparency and user control before sharing.

### GR7 --- Final Iteration

Added review step, AI transparency indicators, and improved onboarding
flow.
